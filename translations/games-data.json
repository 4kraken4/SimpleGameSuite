  "DESC_EIGHTQUEENS": "The Eight Queen Puzzle is a classic problem in the field of computer science and mathematics. The puzzle is based on a chessboard and involves placing eight queens on the board in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should be in the same row, column, or diagonal. The chessboard consists of an 8x8 grid, resulting in 64 squares. Each queen can occupy one square, and the objective of the puzzle is to find a placement where all eight queens are positioned without attacking each other.",
