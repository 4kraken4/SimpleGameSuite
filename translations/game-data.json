  "DESC_EIGHTQUEENS": "The Eight Queen Puzzle is a classic problem in the field of computer science and mathematics. The puzzle is based on a chessboard and involves placing eight queens on the board in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should be in the same row, column, or diagonal. The chessboard consists of an 8x8 grid, resulting in 64 squares. Each queen can occupy one square, and the objective of the puzzle is to find a placement where all eight queens are positioned without attacking each other. This puzzle is often used as a problem-solving exercise and a test of algorithmic skills. It requires careful consideration of possible queen placements and systematic exploration of the solution space to find a valid arrangement. Solving the Eight Queen Puzzle can be done using various algorithms, such as backtracking, recursive techniques, or genetic algorithms. It has been extensively studied and has multiple known solutions. The puzzle showcases the importance of strategic thinking, logical reasoning, and the ability to analyze and visualize spatial relationships. The Eight Queen Puzzle serves as an engaging and challenging problem that stimulates critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. It has applications beyond recreational purposes, as it demonstrates fundamental concepts in computer science and can be used to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms or explore optimization techniques.",
